        <h2>About Course</h2>
        <p>
            Front-end web development, also known as client-side development is the
            practice of producing HTML, CSS and JavaScript for a website or Web
            Application so that a user can see and interact with them directly. The
            challenge associated with front end development is that the tools and
            techniques used to create the front end of a website change constantly and
            so the developer needs to constantly be aware of how the field is
            developing.
